# Geotechnical Chatbot Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Geotechnical Chatbot project! This project utilizes Llamma2, a powerful natural language processing (NLP) library, and Sentence Transformer for embedding to create a chatbot tailored for geotechnical engineering discussions.

## Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Llamma2
- Sentence Transformer
- Other necessary libraries (check requirements.txt)

You can install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrakashDSdeveloper/Geo_chat_bot.git

```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the chatbot:

```bash
python app.py
```

4. Engage in geotechnical discussions with the chatbot!

## Configuration

You can customize the chatbot's behavior and settings by modifying the `config.yml` file. Adjust parameters such as language, model type, and embedding strategy according to your preferences.

## Example Conversations

Feel free to explore example conversations in the `examples` folder. These can serve as a guide for interacting with the chatbot and understanding its capabilities.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you find bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
